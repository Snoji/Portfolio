							<p>Ripple is an app that helps seniors accomplish their bucket list while meeting people and making new connections along the way.</p>
							<blockquote>“Voted Best App out of 12 by instructional staff and peers”</blockquote>
							<p><b>Timeline:</b> 8 weeks <br> <b>Tools:</b> Adobe XD, Illustrator, Pen and Paper</p>

							<h2>The Problem</h2>
							<p>
								Depression is an issue that seniors go through in their old age; Their families sometimes get to busy to interact with them and are, 
								at times, left alone in retirement homes and forgotten about.
							</p>

							<p>
								I wanted to create a way for them to be able to fill their lives with new excitement and in turn, meet new people along the way 
								that would share their enthusiasm for their newfound hobbies. This is why my team and I created Ripple.
							</p>
							

							<h2>Needfinding</h2>
							<p>
								Due to time constraints and a lack of availability, my team and I were unable to do the interviews and field research with senior citizens 
								to identify their core pain points. Instead, I decided to focused on discovering these through online research and the personal experience 
								we have had with our grandparents. From our research, we found a few common user needs.
							</p>
							<p>Some of these included:

							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium" style="text-align: left;">
									<ul >
										<li>Social interaction</li>
										<li>Health and exercise</li>
										<li>Memory problems</li>
										<li>Traveling</li>
										<li>Finishing their bucket list</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
							</div>
						</p>
							
							<h2>Storyboarding</h2>
							<p>
								From these common user needs, my team and I created 10 different personas and storyboards then narrowed it down to two that we felt really encapsulated these needs.
							</p>


							<div class="row"> 
								<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
									<li style="height: 100%;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/storyboard1.jfif" alt="" /></span>
									<p style="text-align: center;"><i>
										Facebook seems too complicated for elderly people to explore new events and new hobbies. However, they still want to make new friends and have new experiences. 
										The “Bucket List App” can solve this problem through user-friendly interfaces and event explorer functions which can also help the users to look for others who 
										are also interested in the same events. Eventually, they can reach their goals — making new connections and having new experiences.
									</i></p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div class="row"> 
								<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
									<li style="height: 100%;">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/storyboard2.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p style="text-align: center;"><i>
											Mark had been working in a long shift job in the previous 45 years. His wife passed away and his children are very busy. The problem he is having is that he always 
											feels bored and lonely in his daily life and always wants someone to accompany him. However, after his daughter introduced the “Bucket List App” to him, 
											he found that there are lots of events, classes, and people of the same age, so he can make new friends and have a new experience. More importantly, he can try Zumba which is an item from his wife’s bucket list.
										</i></p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>


						
						<h2>Accessability</h2>
						<p>
							Keeping in mind the target audience and the pain points my team and I gathered, I thought it would be important to take some time to focus on the accessibility design of our 
							application. From my research and brainstorming, I met with my team and we decided to follow the guidelines found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243168/">here</a>.
						</p> 

						<p>These points are:

							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-10 col-12-medium" style="text-align: left;">
									<ol>
										<li>Maintain a consistent interface through applications.</li>
										<li>Allow images and text to be resized.</li>
										<li>Give clear instructions about how to control the interface during tasks.</li>
										<li>Clearly delineate what is expected behavior during a task.</li>
										<li>Clearly delineate tutorials from actual training tasks.</li>
										<li>Show demonstrations in tutorials that match the difficulty of actual tasks.</li>
										<li>Allow adequate time between instructions and the start of tasks.</li>
										<li>Display progress through a task.</li>
										<li>Allow tasks to be skipped.</li>
										<li>Clearly delineate when a task is complete.</li>
									</ol>
								</div>
							</div>
						</p>

						
						<h2>Prototyping and User Flow</h2>
						<p>
							Now that my team and I have better defined what we are looking to answer in our app, I began to design what the app will look like and how it will flow.
						</p>

						<span class="image"><img src="images/rippleuserflow.jpeg" style="width:100%">
							<p><i>First sketches and user flow of the app.</i></p>
						</span>

						<p>Some key features we wanted to make sure our app had are an Explore page, Bucket List, Bookmarks, and Activities page.</p>

						<span class="image"><img src="images/ripplefeatures.png" style="width: 100%;">
							<p><i>Beta prototype of the app</i></p>
						</span>



						<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
						<p>
							Due to the time and availability constraints, Me and a partner performed usability testing with our classmates and the instructional staff. 
							We tested with the 12 other groups and 3 instructional staff. Some of the feedback we received included things like, make sure the text and buttons 
							are large, and add text with icons so the user won’t have to guess what they mean.
						</p>

						<p>
							From this great feedback, My team and I then went to design our next and final prototype, do a competitive analysis, and ready for our presentation.
						</p>



						<h2>Competitve Analysis</h2>
						<span class="image"><img src="images/ripplecompanalysis.png"></span>
						<p></p>

						
						<h2>Branding</h2>
						<p>
							We decided to name our app ‘Ripple’. A ripple effect is caused when a droplet hits a larger body of water. We felt that our app, which would get people 
							out there and experience new things, and meet new people, was akin to this phenomenon.
						</p>

						<p>
							We made our logo the bucket, as we felt the best direction to market our app would be to really push the bucket list idea. The bucket list is a checklist 
							comprised of one’s aspirations, which would make our app more appealing than the competition.
						</p>

						<h2>Marketing</h2>
						<p>
							For this project, my team and I also created a demo and commercial for our application. This was a great bonding activity for our group and we got to know 
							each other a bit better.
						</p>

						<h2>Final Prototype</h2>

						<p>
							After all of our hard work, we finished our final prototype and presented it alongside a “shark tank” style pitch to our peers and instructors.
						</p>
						<span class="image"><img src="images/ripplefinalproto.png"></span>
						<p></p>
						<p>
							We ended up winning Best App out of the 12 other presentations, voted by our instructional staff and peers!
						</p>

						<h2>The Future</h2>
						<p>
							If I were to continue this project into the future, I would work on integrating this app with other apps, make connections worldwide with other countries, 
							and make improvements on accessibility. I would also love to do more user research and testing with the target audience to gather better and deeper insights 
							and pain points that I could address.
						</p>
						

						<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
						<p>
							I am very grateful for this experience and the people I was able to share it with. I learned a lot about the pace of 
							short term projects, design thinking, and improved my skills with design tools. Even though each day was jam-packed with things to do, I thoroughly enjoyed 
							and had fun with every moment of it.

								<h3>About</h3>
								<p>My team and I were tasked to create an application, in 5 weeks, that catered to the most 
								overlooked age group - people 45 years and older. Ripple attempts to answer 
								this by providing them with a place to keep track off their bucket list while 
								finding new hobbies and fostering new connections along the way.​​​​​​​</p>

								<h3>Key Skills</h3>
								<p>Rapid Ideation • Experience Design • Prototyping • Branding</p>

							<span class="image right"><img src="images/Ripple2.JPG"></span>
							
								<h3>Problem</h3>
								<p>As people grow older, they want to start checking things off of their 
								bucket list. However, it is hard to find ways to accomplish these tasks and
								keep track of the rest. Along with this, old age brings about problems
								such as loneliness, lack of social interaction, and in extreme cases, depression.</p>

								<h3>My Role</h3>
								<p>UX/UI Designer</p>


								<h3>Design Process</h3>
								<p>We documented our design process on <a href="https://medium.com/@dancingqueens007" target="_blank">Medium</a>.</p> -->
